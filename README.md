# Weather-App-using-API-Vidhi_Bhatt
A hands on project to strengthen my skills after learning about API's.<br>

This a simple <b>Weather App</b> made using <b> OpenWeather's API </b>
<br>It first asks the user to input the city name , after writing the city name in the text field press enter to view the current weather of that place.
